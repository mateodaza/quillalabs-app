That's my family Kay, that's not me. My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born? Do me this favor. I won't forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor. I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English. Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in."
